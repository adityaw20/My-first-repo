            Welcome to Car and Driver. We've created this page to introduce ourselves to you and to let you know <br>what it is we do around here. Car and Driver is a print and digital magazine covering the newest <br>car offerings, showcasing car culture, and helping people shopping for a car by serving up our<br> unique brand of intelligence, independence, and irreverence. We've been in the magazine business<br> since 1955 and online for more than two decades.

            We make the complicated easier to understand for those of you shopping<br> for a new car and push the limits of performance machines for our enthusiast readers. <br>A Car and Driver review balances the subjective with objective data and pulls no punches;<br> on our best days, we hope we even give you a good laugh.
