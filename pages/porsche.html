        The <b>Porsche 911 GT3 RS </b>is a petrol-powered vehicle with a 3996 cc engine and <br/>automatic transmission. It can go from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.2 seconds and has a<br/> top speed of 296 km/h.

    <H2>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</H2>
    <p>
        In the tail end of the 911 GT3 is a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six that makes 502 horsepower.<br/> The engine is essentially identical to the one that powered the last 911 Speedster we tested, <br/>which spun to 9000 rpm and wailed hypnotically. The GT3 offers both a seven-speed dual-clutch <br/>automatic (a.k.a. PDK) or a six-speed manual. The PDK-equipped example we drove showcased <br/>the automatic's intuitive behavior as well as the engine's spirited responses and intoxicating soundtrack. <br/>At our test track, the automatic managed a 2.7-second 60-mph time while the six-speed manual test<br/> vehicle snapped off an impressive 3.3-second run to 60 mph. The GT3 RS and S/T models get tuned <br/>up to 518 horsepower and come with more aero elements to increase downforce to stick them to the<br/> road. The GT3 RS comes with an outrageous rear wing that incorporates a drag-reduction system <br/>similar to those on Formula 1 race cars. At our test track, the GT3 RS hit 60 mph in the same 2.7<br/> seconds as the automatic GT3 we tested, but thanks to those downforce-enhancing add-ons, it pulled 1.16 gs<br/> on our skidpad versus the GT3's 1.11 g result. The most notable performance upgrade on this latest <br/>generation of GT3 models is their control-arm front suspension, which is a first for a production 911. Combine that with standard adaptive dampers and sticky Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2–or stickier Cup R–tires and the coupe's chassis provides tremendous cornering grip and unfiltered feedback. While the GT3's ride is undeniably firm it's never punishing, and the electrically assisted steering is so divinely communicative that it deserves anointment as the best in the business. The RS is stiffened up for the track to the point where some drivers may find it a bit too uncomfortable for the street. But if you're one of those folks, consider the Touring model instead. Stopping the purist's Porsches are massive steel binders; a carbon-ceramic option provides heroic braking power, easy modulation, and resists fade at the track. We also tested a 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 RS as part of a 0-to-150-to-0 speed test where it returned to a stop in just 24.4 seconds.
